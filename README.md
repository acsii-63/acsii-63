####    "I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan. I'm an engineer. I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around, staring at the clouds, looking at the stars and saying: "I want to go there." But I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in. This is the kind of person I am."
